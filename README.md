### Snippet

The directory holding the manifest file
can be added as an extension in developer mode in its current state.



  Open the Extension Management page by
  navigating to
  chrome://extensions.


    The Extension Management page can also be opened by
    clicking on the Chrome menu,
    hovering over More Tools
    then selecting Extensions.




  Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch
  next to Developer mode.


  Click the LOAD UNPACKED button
  and select the extension directory.
  
  ![Load Extension](https://developer.chrome.com/static/images/get_started/load_extension.png)




Ta-da!
The extension has been successfully installed.
Because no icons were included in the manifest,
a generic toolbar icon will be created for the extension.
